Arrest of ships is also a typical jurisdictional basis in  the maritime sphere; but outside maritime claims...This  thesis analyses the theme in English and Scots law in the  light of  the international Conventions in the  field. It examines the three main  functions of arrest of ships, i.e. its protective function, its security   function   and its jurisdictional function, within the three classical domains of PIL,  i.e. applicable law, jurisdiction, and the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments. It  looks at the  role of the lex fori;  its impact on characterization issues; its subtleties when  applied qua lex causae; and its so often too  far -reaching scope when applied qua lex fori. In practice its influence is unhelpful and  poses a drawback to the uniformity  sought by  the international community. Its downside is apparent in English  law where the frame in which  arrest of ships  currently  develops is the  action in rem, and where the impossibility to separate the two has complicated matters in various ways. In Scots law, due to the fact that arrestment of ships pertains to the broader law of diligence, the distinction between the different  functions of the arrest of ships is clearer. Furthermore, recent law reform has brought the arrestment of ships in Scotland into line with the latest international trends in the sphere of provisional  and  protective measures....Central to this  thesis is the jurisdictional function of arrest of ships. Forum arresti, the paradigmatic forum selection  criterion in English and Scots law, has survived as a specific jurisdictional basis for maritime claims  in  the process of Europeanization of  PIL. This thesis  establishes that forum arresti in the case  of arrest of ships is a cooperative forum. It advances the dynamic objective of  PIL, i.e. the juridical continuity of legal relations across national  borders. In this  context,  the conceptual distinction  between jurisdiction on the merits and  jurisdiction for the sole purpose of interim relief becomes paramount....Ultimately, the whole analysis  shows that the combination of civilian legacy, common law creativity and  international attempts for uniformity has profoundly affected  the nature of arrest of ships; not only in England  and in Scotland, but, through their influence on international Conventions, in the entire shipping world....

For the first time in history naval architects were able to construct great vessels able to forge their way across the trackless ocean in face of raging storms. Here was an opportunity to establish better quarters for the personnel; an opportunity, alas, missed. It is true that, stimulated by such men as ',filbert Blane, the responsible authorities of H. M.

The decrease in disease has been a striking one, although ships of the Navy carry large complements necessary for manoeuvring and fighting, and although they house their men in cramped quarters..... Of relatively few British merchantmen, however, can this be said - a shameful admission for the world's leading maritime nation....The hygiene of crews' quarters aroused the interest of the author while he was serving as a Surgeon in the employ of the Cunard Steamship Company. Later, when he was attached to the London Port Sanitary Authority he investigated the subject as it applied to ships of varying tonnages and different nationalities. On appointment to the Hull and Goole Fort Sanitary Authority he continued the investigation more intensively....Unfortunately there is no accurate comprehensive statistical information available regarding the type of accommodation found in British and Foreign shipping. To overcome this difficulty a scheme for surveying ships visiting the Ports of Hull and Goole was instituted. It is upon the results obtained from this survey that the present thesis is based. It is hoped that the conclusions arrived at will clearly indicate a definite need, not only for improvement in the conditions in which men of the Merchant Service live, but also for a thorough revision of the administration and powers affecting the sanitation of vessels of the British Mercantile Marine....
